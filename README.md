## Getting a Local Version
1. On [github](https://github.com/sblack4/major-viz) click `Fork`
2. It'll stick a fork in a book.  When that is done you should be at `https://github.com/<your-username>/major-viz`
3. Wherever you'd like the `major-viz` folder open your terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/major-viz.git`

** make sure to substitute `<your-username>` for your actual github username
** if you don't have git installed they have a nice GUI at [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/) so you don't have to do git command line stuff

## Contributing 

Git is a Version Control System, that let's teams of developers 
work on large codebases without letting them break it (atleast it provides a way to un-break it)

The internet has done a fantastic job of covering `git` basics, 
there are free [books](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics) about 
it, awesome [tutorials you can do in your browser](https://try.github.io/) ,
and [loads of documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html)

Basically here's how it will work: 

* `git clone <project-here>` to get it on your computer
* `git add .` to add files & changes
* `git commit -m "<message-ie-just-added-to-readme>"` to commit those changes to the log
* `git push` to send those changes back up to git
